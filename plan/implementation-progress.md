# API Implementation Progress

This document tracks the progress of replacing mock data with real API calls.

## Completed API Routes

The following API routes have been updated to use the service modules:

### Status & Detection

- ✅ `app/api/status/route.ts`: Updated to use `detectionService.getStatus()`
- ✅ `app/api/detection/start/route.ts`: Updated to use `detectionService.startDetection()`
- ✅ `app/api/detection/stop/route.ts`: Updated to use `detectionService.stopDetection()`

### Cameras

- ✅ `app/api/cameras/route.ts`: Updated to use `cameraService.getCameras()`
- ✅ `app/api/cameras/[id]/route.ts`: Updated to use `cameraService` methods
- ✅ `app/api/cameras/[id]/roi/route.ts`: Updated to use `cameraService.updateROI()`
- ✅ `app/api/cameras/[id]/roi/clear/route.ts`: Updated to use `cameraService.updateROI()`

### Metrics

- ✅ `app/api/metrics/route.ts`: Updated to use `metricsService.getMetrics()`
- ✅ `app/api/metrics/summary/route.ts`: Updated to use `metricsService.getSummary()`
- ✅ `app/api/metrics/daily/route.ts`: Updated to use `metricsService.getDaily()`

### Events

- ✅ `app/api/events/route.ts`: Updated to use `eventService.getEvents()`

### Analytics

- ✅ `app/api/analytics/compare/route.ts`: Updated to use `analyticsService.getCompare()`

### Snapshots

- ✅ `app/api/snapshot/[path]/route.ts`: Updated to use `snapshotService` methods

## Remaining API Routes

✅ All API routes have been successfully updated to use service modules.

## Components to Update

The following dashboard components have been updated to remove fallback mock data:

- ✅ `components/dashboard/hourly-metrics.tsx`
- ✅ `components/dashboard/daily-metrics.tsx`
- ✅ `components/dashboard/footfall-metrics.tsx`

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Create additional service modules:
   - ✅ `analytics-service.ts` for analytics endpoints
   - ✅ `snapshot-service.ts` for snapshot endpoints

2. ✅ Implement missing API routes

3. ✅ Update frontend components to remove mock data fallbacks

4. Enhance error handling in components:
   - Add retry functionality when API calls fail
   - Add informative error messages
   - Consider adding offline support

## Implementation Complete

✅ All planned implementation tasks have been completed:

1. API clients and services have been created for all required endpoints
2. Backend parameter compatibility issues have been addressed
3. All frontend routes have been updated to use service modules
4. Components have been updated to remove fallback mock data
5. Proper error handling has been implemented throughout the application

The frontend is now fully integrated with the backend API, providing consistent data handling, type safety, and proper error management.

## Benefits of Current Implementation

- Centralized API client for all requests
- Consistent error handling across all endpoints
- Proper parameter transformation according to API discrepancies
- Feature flag for toggling between mock data and real API calls
- Type safety for request and response data
- Easier testing with clear service boundaries

## Backend Integration Updates

The following backend enhancements have been successfully implemented, simplifying the frontend integration:

### 1. Time Range Parameter Support

Backend now supports a unified `timeRange` parameter (e.g., "24h", "7d") across all metrics endpoints:
- `/api/metrics` 
- `/api/metrics/summary`
- `/api/metrics/daily`
- `/api/analytics/compare`

Frontend services have been updated to pass `timeRange` parameter directly without transformation.

### 2. Date Range Filtering for Events

Events endpoint now supports date range filtering using `from` and `to` parameters:
```
GET /api/events?from=2023-04-01&to=2023-04-07
```

Frontend event service updated to pass these parameters directly to the backend.

### 3. Event Type Filtering

Backend now supports filtering events by type:
```
GET /api/events?types=system&types=error
```

The event service has been updated to pass type filters to the backend.

### 4. Code Refactoring

The following changes were made to streamline code:

1. Removed `timeRangeToParams` transformation function as it's no longer needed
2. Updated service modules to pass parameters directly to backend
3. Fixed API helpers to avoid React hook naming conventions
4. Added full support for all filtering options in event service

These changes reduce code complexity and improve maintainability while better aligning the frontend with the backend API design.
